<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Ohmyfood screenshot][product-screenshot]](#)

Ohmyfood! is an fictive online meal ordering company. Their concept allows users to compose their own menu and reduce their waiting time in restaurants as their menu is prepared in advance.

This project is their mobile app, proposing the menu of 4 great Parisian restaurants. It was made as a student project.

This project was made from these mockups:

- [Home page](docs/homepage.png)
- [Menu page from the "A la française" restaurant](docs/menupage-a-la-francaise.png)
- [Menu page from the "La note enchantée" restaurant](docs/menupage-la-note-enchantee.png)
- [Menu page from the "La palette du goût" restaurant](docs/menupage-la-palette-du-gout.png)
- [Menu page from the "Le délice des sens" restaurant](docs/menupage-le-delice-des-sens.png)

... and from these animations:

- [Animation 1](docs/animation-1.mp4)
- [Animation 2](docs/animation-2.mp4)

The requirements were:

- Development should be done in CSS, without JavaScript.
- No framework should be used, however the use of SASS would be a plus.
- No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag.
- All code should be versioned on GitHub and the site should be accessible on Github Pages once completed.
- As the target audience is connected and in a hurry, the site will be developed using
  mobile-first approach. For this reason, only mobile mockups will be made.
- On tablet and desktop, the site will have to adapt, but given that these supports are not a priority, their layout is open to a personnal vision from the developper.
- The whole site will have to be responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop.
- The pages will have to pass the W3C validation in HTML and CSS without error.
- The site must be fully compatible with the latest desktop versions of Chrome and Firefox.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

In this project, you have an home page displaying the front side of the application. It shows 4 restaurants that you'll be able to like (this will require javascript, the project did not focus on this functionality) and you can click on each of them to access to the page dedicated to each of them.
The 4 restaurants pages display the menus proposed by these restaurants. These menus show up with an animation. When you move the mouse over an element of the menu, you can see another animation.
